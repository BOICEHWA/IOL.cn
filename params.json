Each year, teams of young linguists from around the world gather and test their minds against the world's toughest puzzles in language and linguistics.\r\n\r\n> No prior knowledge of linguistics or languages is required: even the hardest problems require only your logical ability, patient work, and willingness to think around corners. Give some of our past problems a try!\r\n\r\nFor more details, please visit its [homepage](http://ioling.org).\r\n\r\n###About IOL.cn\r\n\r\nIOL.cn is a project of translating past IOL problems into Chinese. It contains all files needed to compile the Chinese translation on a computer with ``XeLaTeX`` installed and a copy of compiled PDF files.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please view [our project on GitHub](https://github.com/notcome/IOL.cn).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
